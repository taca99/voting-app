# üó≥Ô∏è Decentralized Voting ‚Äì Web4 Project

This is our team project developed as a **functional prototype of a digital product** leveraging Web4 technologies:  
- **Decentralized Identity (DID)**  
- **Blockchain & Smart Contracts**  
- **AI Integration**  
- **Cross-chain Interoperability**  
- **User-owned Data Storage (IPFS)**  

The goal of the application is to enable **secure, transparent, and fair voting** without central authorities or manipulation.

## üìñ Project Description

Our product is a **decentralized voting platform** that allows users to:  
- log in using **decentralized identity** (crypto wallet authentication),  
- cast votes recorded on the **blockchain** with immutability,  
- store voting data on **IPFS** (decentralized storage),  
- leverage **AI tools** to detect anomalies and prevent potential manipulation in the voting process.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Vite, TypeScript  
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS, shadcn-ui  
- **Blockchain**: Solidity smart contract (testnet)  
- **Storage**: IPFS (decentralized storage)  
- **AI**: API integration for anomaly detection & bot prevention
